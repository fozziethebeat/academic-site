  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Here’s some answers <a href="https://proof-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/firstround/50%20Questions%20for%20Co-Founders.pdf">50 questions to explore with a potential co-founder</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Strength and superpower: I’m generally quite calm in difficult and
  stressful situations.  I have a pretty high tolerance for things going
wrong so I’m usually able to look at a situation, take a deep breath, and then
figure out someway of moving forward.</li>
  <li>Weaknesses: Because I’m generally calm and unbothered by things, I can
  periodically underevaluate risks or ways a situation could go badly.  For
example, I often throw out paperwork I think is unimportant only to discover
that it’s actually pretty important.  I fix this by partnering with people that
prevent me from overlooking complications.</li>
  <li>How do co-workers describe me? Often they’ve described me as pretty
  idealistic, I’d like to make a world or environment much better than
currently exists.  Past reports thought I was generally inspiring and very
active in community development.  Several co-workers mentioned that I take
really clear and concise notes during meetings.</li>
  <li>Conflict: One work conflict that I didn’t deal with effectively was when
  I wanted to collaborate with a sibling team but one of the leads was
generally uninterested.  I was hoping to figuring out a plan that would benefit
us both but the lead refused to share their ideas or plans, nor did they give
much feedback.  This culminated in an arbitration session involving our joint
manager and led to us overall deciding to ignore each other.  A conflict that
worked out pretty well was when I once criticized a team’s work for being hard
to use.  Unintentionally I insulted a friend and colleagues work when I was
intending to push the team’s manager to prioritize the work my friend was
doing.  After realizing the harm I did I took the time to listen to how they
interpreted my email and what they were hoping to accomplish.  I apologized and
shared my primary motivations and how they align with my friend’s goals and we
figured out a different strategy to get their work prioritized.</li>
  <li>Worst interpersonal conflict: That clearly happened with my dad.  He
  spent a weekend visiting my Mom and me and on the final day he told my
mom, directly to her face, that she was ruining my life and that by being in my
life I’d never get married.  I, as calmly as I could, tried to calm my mom down
and assure her that his words didn’t reflect how I felt.  I then immediately
told my dad to stop talking, prepare his things and silently drove him to the
airport.  I was exceptionally mad and decided it was better to not yet or argue
with him given that he would only insist he was right.  The best option given
the situation was to send him on his way before I said anything that might
become hurtful.</li>
  <li>Stress:  I don’t stress out very easily. I do encounter depression but
   that mostly derives from being isolated too long or feeling left out.
But with stress I tend to enjoy fixing challenging situations and honestly
after several family incidents in my past and being nearly homeless a few
times, work stress isn’t that challenging.</li>
  <li>Convictions: My only real convictions stem from Buddhism, which
   ultimately just say that everything changes and we define how we deal
with that change.  everything else is more of a lightly held idea of how the
future could turn out.  I like to follow my intuitions of solving problems for
other people as that’s generally made my life better.  Doing that right
requires a lot of listening to ensure I’ve really understood someone else’s
experience.</li>
  <li>Work style: My work style is fairly adapted to my living environment,
  which has changed multiple times.  Right now my partner and I live in the
mountains far from most people so I’ve kept myself to fairly routine and
regular working hours to maintain a rhythm.  Depending on what needs doing I
switch between writing ideas on paper, reading sources that might create some
inspiration, talking through ideas with others, and just building things.  One
key part: I’m a kinesthetic learner so to fully get an idea I need to write it
down, repeat it out loud , or build it.</li>
  <li>Right now I’m pretty flexible on how much time I can work.  However, I’m
  at an age where I want to make sure I preserve plenty of time for hobbies
and personal time with my partner and friends.  So something like 40 to 50
hours sounds pretty good.  In the next few years I hope to have baby and to be
the primary care giver so my partner can reach some of her career goals so that
will reduce my capacity to work long hours.</li>
  <li>Roles: I enjoy facilitating ideation to figure out both what situation
we’re currently in and what ideas are feasible with the resources
available.  As a technical person I also assume I’d be heavily responsible for
ensuring technical projects get build and meet whatever criteria we setup.  I
also enjoy governance discussions to ensure we’re meeting the needs of who
we’re creating for and that we’re following general ethics.</li>
  <li>Growth: I don’t want to actively write code forever.  At previous stages
 of life I enjoyed mentoring and so I’d very much like to help others join
the organization and be the ones that actively build technical solutions while
I help coach, mentor, or train.  This would also entail being heavily involved
in hiring and ensuring it’s not moving too quickly.</li>
  <li>Different Roles: That’s a good question I’d have to think about.  If
 targeting a rapid growth trajectory I’d probably want to focus on
ensuring we’re following ethical guidelines and that we’re actively developing
new ideas to solve harder problems we’ve discovered.</li>
  <li>AoR:
    <ul>
      <li>Sales: 1</li>
      <li>Marketing: 2</li>
      <li>Product Strategy: 5</li>
      <li>Design: 3</li>
      <li>Engineering: 10</li>
      <li>Operations: 5</li>
      <li>Fundraising: 3</li>
      <li>Leadership: 5</li>
      <li>Company Building: 4</li>
      <li>Recruiting: 6</li>
      <li>Legal: 3</li>
      <li>Specific (Machine Learning): 8</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The startup should probably be legally formed in the United States.  But
  given that I live in the Japan Alps I’d prefer a remote first strategy
with planned team bonding time centered in California.</li>
  <li>My only major limitation is that I plan to have a baby and want to ensure
 I have time to do the primary care giving for the first few years of the
child’s life.  I currently have permanent residency in Japan so no requirements
to continue working in the country I live in.</li>
  <li>I like distributed ownership so a significant chunk of ownership rights
should be pooled for future owners (workers, consumer members if this
becomes a multi-stakeholder cooperative).  Less than 50% should be distributed
to founders.  I also generally think that ownership should be based on how long
we’re planning to be dedicated to the effort rather than whatever
“foundational” work we do early on in creation of the company.  Making
something works requires execution much more than it requires ideation.</li>
  <li>In a dream land the business would be partially a worker-cooperative
whereby workers have equal governance rights.  Financially they should
get a goot salary and a share of the profits that are developed.  That is maybe
long term equity or revenue sharing.  It probably depends on who we hire.</li>
  <li>Right now, given what i’ve heard about fundraising, I prefer to take
little to no money and figure out a path to bootstrapping to some
revenue based cash flow.  Once a really good idea is settled and we have some
idea on how to scale it we can debate taking large sums of investments to scale
it to an appropriate growth.  I don’t personally aspire to be a Unicorn, I’d
much rather raise just the right amount of funding to hit a happy size and then
see how long that can last.</li>
  <li>I’d like to ensure a funder agrees with our governance structure (if
we’re a multi-stakeholder cooperative, they have to agree to those
terms).  They also have to agree with our overall mission and commit to
evaluating our performance on the goals we jointly consent too.</li>
  <li>I think it’d be pretty cool to <a href="https://e2c.how/">exit to community</a> and
distribute ownership to workers and customers.  Financially I’m pretty
happy so as long as I have some way of making a decent income (around 200k USD
would be rad) I’m doing great.</li>
  <li>I’d like to get to revenue as quickly as possible as I believe free cash
flow is a strong sign there’s a viable business.  However, I’m willing
to take a long time growing to being a larger company.  Right now I want to
test what I can accomplish and haven’t set any precise timelines to do it.  If
I can pull off something cool that I’m proud of, even if it takes decades, I’ll
be pretty satisfied.</li>
  <li>I have never thought about selling a company.  I’d want to sell only if
a buyer was dedicated to providing better services to our customers
than we can offer in the long term.</li>
  <li>If founders aren’t excited about the product, it’s not right for the
team.  We would not be able to lead and guide it with the necessary 
motivation.  So  in that case selling the idea and part of the organization is
probably the best solution to meeting the needs of the market we discovered.</li>
  <li>Co founders should always talk with each other and ensure they’re
following the needs of the customers.  It should be the boards decision
on who to fire (or a decision made by workers if there are any workers).  A
radical view I have is that workers should be able to fire a founder if the
founder is really goign against the aims and motivations of the organization.
For example, SpaceX should probably consider firing Elon Musk for making it
hard for them to operate.</li>
  <li>I’m personally intersted in creating something new and seeing if
there’s a way to structure it so that all impacted stakeholders have a
say in how the organization is goverend.  I’d like to test the common practices
of corporate structure to see if a more ideal structure can be discovered.</li>
  <li>Success is simply solving someone elses problem enough that they find
value in paying for a service or a product.  At a personal level I
consider myself successful to the extent that I reduce the suffering of those
around me and in the world in general.</li>
  <li>Practicing a new form of capitalism would be pretty radical.  If we’re
able to find a way that more people can decide what’s important in a
company, and ensure all ethical considerations are considered, then that’s a
huge win.</li>
  <li>When i was about 20 I slept behind a couch in my friends living room
for about 18 months.  At the same time I stocked shelves in a nearby
Target between 11pm to 6am so that I could afford jr. college.  That made me
pretty gritty.</li>
  <li>Within my family, my great grandmother Luise managed to accumulate a
lot of property that she managed.  That eventually helped support much
of my family and helped me buying a house for my Mom.  What she managed to
accomplish while being an immigrant in America was amazing and I hope to do
something supportive like that.  Beyond my family, I have really admired
several monks I’ve spent time with while studying Buddhism.  They’re broad
minded approach to life and readiness to feel the world around them has helped
me a lot.</li>
  <li>I’m most proud of the people I’ve mentored that have found success that
they’re proud of.  I used to mentor a group of students at a Buddhist
temple and many of them have found lives they love.  I’ve also recently helped
mentor a group of girls finding their place in the tech world and it’s great
seeing their excitement to try out ideas of their making.</li>
  <li>During the pandemic my partner and I very quickly decided we should try
living in the mountains.  Our friends were sort of thinking about it
but not taking action.  We came up with the idea and within about 4 months we
made it happen and had fully moved our lives.  There were a lot of unknowns,
such as if we’d like living so far away from people, but it turns out to have
been a great choice for us personally and we’re sticking with it.</li>
  <li>I used to admire Basecamp but then they imploded and I saw how they
really operate.  So that’s too bad.  There’s a lot of aspects of Google
that I like and still admire but there’s also a lot that I don’t want to
replicate, such as the focus on quarterly earnings and the efficiency decisions
made without worker input.  I do really love what Hugging Face is doing in the machine learning space and hope they stick to their ideas.</li>
  <li>It’s probably not possible to make a unicorn earning a bajillion
dollars without sacrificing a personal life.  But in my more narrow
definition of success whereby customers are happy and ownership is more broadly
shared, I think it’s totally possible to find wild success and a good personal
life.</li>
  <li>Yes, this effort will be my primary activity until I have a baby.  In
the winter I hope to spend a few hours a day skiing.</li>
  <li>Right now I can dedicate my full time and I expect that to remain true
for at least a year.  Within 2 years my time will decrease due to said
parenting expectations.</li>
  <li>I have enough personal runway to live out my current expenses for about
2 years.  I plan to take on some consulting to help extend that runway.
If i had to invest my own money my runway would shrink a bit but with a good
idea i’d of course invest some, primarily by paying the most essential bills.</li>
  <li>As of next year when I’ve help ensure my Mom can cover her expenses, I
think I can survive on $3k a month.  I’ve really made it if I can make
$10k a month (my previous Google total compensation amounted to about $41K a
month).</li>
  <li>I’m not entirely sure I understand the question.  Let’s talk.</li>
  <li>It would make me proud to hear people describe the company’s culture as
democratic and ethical.</li>
  <li>I think great people aspire to solve the same problem that the company
has set out.  When I tried to hire new grads at Google it was easy to
find engineers that were <em>great</em> at writing code but we’re more excited to
solve technical puzzles than figure out how to solve other peoples challenges.
I always picked candidates that loved our team’s mission and wanted to grow
into solving the problems we were facing.  I’m confident many skills can be
trained and developed but commitment to the problem can’t be trained.  So the make it happen, we first have to really define the problem being solved, then make sure <em>everyone</em> knows what we’re solving.</li>
  <li>I’m still figuring out how to make teams the most successful but I
stick to the policy of making sure everyone fully agrees on the problem
we’re solving.  Then, once our motivations fully agree, it takes listening to
figure out what might be limiting success and then figuring out what
development is needed.</li>
  <li>When the team is small I expect most of the time will be spent talking
to potential customers and the founding team when we’re not actively
building a thing.  Once the team is growing I expect at least 50% of my time to
be dedicated to communicating with people.</li>
  <li>Within Google I was a part of several DEI efforts and have continued
that once out of Google.  I believe that most everyone can be inspired
to solve some socially important problem and with the right amount of support,
coaching, and self development time, they can be effective at solving the
problems they find motivating.  I think that happens by ensuring the youth
(teenagers) of all economic backgrounds see that they can solve problems they
care about and that they have opportunities to learn from others.  I do that
right now through Technovation Girls in Japan given that tech has left women
out within Japan (more dramatically than most other countries) but how it looks
in other environments will end up being context dependent.</li>
  <li>How to prioritize co-founder relationships, that’s a hard one.
Quarterly meet ups will be essential since some time in the same space
can be really important. When I sent to meditation retreats this was always an
impactful way to better bond with people I saw only very rarely.</li>
  <li>I think personal conflicts can always be solved by first asking
ourselves what we’re feeling in the situation, what prior (or
externally influenced) feelings or motivations we’re introducing, and what
we’re ignoring about the other person’s perspective.  Then we can better listen
to what the other is truly saying and figure out a compromise.  As long as we
fully agree on the problem we’re aiming to solve, everything else comes down
our ability to negotiate a compromise.</li>
  <li>In a startup divorce, ownership should go in the direction of whomever
is most dedicated to follow the mission of the startup.  I’d hope that
we’re each emotionally mature enough to be honest about our dedication to the
challenge even if it means stepping back.</li>
  <li>Is this question about personal growth or business growth? Let’s assume
it’s business growth.  I’m going to further assume we’re not growing
for one of a few reasons: a) we’re building a product no one wants and we’ve
been ignoring our customers, b) we’re not charging the right price and can’t
sustain ourselves, c) we’re afraid of taking a risk due to some concern we
haven’t communicated.  For each of these, we’d have to figure out who we have
to better communicate with and start that process.</li>
  <li>I think the best way to handle resentments is to always be discussing
what we’re expecting out of the partnership and be open about our
dissatisfactions.  Non Violent Communication is great at this by clearly saying
“I Feel (upset, worried, mad, insulted, etc) when (specific situation
happened)”  With this we can each share to ensure no dissatisfactions sit
around and ferment.</li>
  <li>Shared ownership is the goal so this is inevitable.  We’d of course have to discuss what roles they want to take on.</li>
  <li>This one I can’t answer until it’s a two way conversation :)</li>

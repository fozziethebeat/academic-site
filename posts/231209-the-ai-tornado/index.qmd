## The High Tech Marketing Theory that works: the Tornado

Today's hot disruptive technology has one name, Generative AI.  We know it's
disrupting things and generating tons of investment and tons of money with lots
of companies acting hastily.  But what should we expect of the market? What is
an engineer to make of the upcoming future? I don't know but during the 90's a
tech marketing master named Geoffrey Moore wrote two books, [Crossing the
Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986)
and [Into the
Tornado](https://www.amazon.com/Inside-Tornado-Strategies-Developing-Hypergrowth/dp/0060745819).
Together I find them a perfect description of what tech "distruption" really
means, and how a disruptive technology flows through markets.  Does it still
apply to today's digital SaaS products? I think so.  And even if it doesn't I'm
going to fit a square into a circle and see what happens.

personality"){fig-align="center"}

So, what is Tornado Theory, as I understand it? This is an older name for what
we now call high growth markets, aka the land of startups and aspiring
unicorns.  In these scenarios, there's existing or old markets comfortable with
some old timey slow and reliable solution.  Some new technology shows up and
impresses the high tech audience (my crowd) until it gains the attention of
some small set of visionary business leaders that see a bit into the future.
Then most startups die as they fall into a chasm where they fail to market the
product to the much larger and more pragmatic customers that their investors
need.  The few startups utilizing the new tech that make it through go onto 
strategic market land grabs until the large pool of pragmatic customers feel
ready to buy.  Then suddenly *every*  pragmatic customer wants the product and
they want it now, they want it fast, and they want it from the market leader.
Those that win in the tornado come out unicorns.

Successful companies need to deploy different leadership qualities to survive
each stage.  At the visionary stage they need to get product innovation right.
Just after the chasm, they need to keep developing the product, partner
aggressively, and focus on the customer.  But as soon as the pragmatic
customers decide to start buying in mass, successful companies should,
according to Moore's theory, completely forget the customer and their many
particular wants and desires and instead 100% focus on delivering the product
as fast as possible.  Any lost sale due to lack of supply goes to some other
competitor for the lifetime of the market.  Winners sell hard and fast with a
much lower emphasis, even no emphasis, on hard product innovation.

As this tornado is crushing older business models and leaving everyone
wondering who will survive and who will be the winner, the market naturally
sorts companies into three distinct groups: Gorillas, Chimps, and Monkeys.  Why
these three groups? Because they give nice analogies to relative strength
between each player.  Gorillas are, well, the winner of the tornado.  They set
the standard, they define the product category, they take the largest market
share and the largest portion of the profits.  The chimps are the competitors
with equally good, or even sometimes better, technology but who failed to work
the market right.  They survive by being the nicer company that still cares
about the customer and does some key innovation the Gorilla doesn't do.  The
monkeys are everyone else that's busy trying to provide low cost clones of the
top line product.  Its a little gross and brutal, but so are the market
machines that produce unicorns.

![](231209-tornado-players-sm.png "The market isn't kind enough to let these
three be friends, but we can pretend right?"){fig-align="center"}

Now, this theory worked well in the 90s and 2000s when products were generally
hard physical things that required a purchase and support from slower
distribution channels like retail stores.  These days tho high tech products go
through the internet with either self-service SaaS or some convoluted
enterprise sales flow.  Either way, things move faster.  I'm too much of an
engineer to exactly know how this changes Moore's theory but I'm pretty sure it
just means some parts of the cycle compress and overlap more than they used to.
Either way, I'm pretty sure this Tornado is tearing through the tech world
right now in the form of Generative AI.  So let's cut to the chase.

## Aligning AI: with our tornado market theory

Today's disruptive technology is most obviously generative AI, in the form of
Large Language Models, Multimodal Modals, and Image/Video generation.  But
what's not clear is where the Generative AI market is in terms of the standard
[tech adoption life
cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle).  Nor is
it clear what the true "whole product" solution is.  Aside: the whole product
is the minimal set of associated products or services needed to maximally
leverage the disruptive technology.  Also, with the entire space of Generative
AI, there's likely multiple actual markets.  So for simplicity, I want to focus
on Large Language Models as the baseline disruptive technology.

These started pretty early in machine translation where transformers were first
applied.  Both my old team, [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/),
and our up and coming competitor, [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator),
demonstrated their visionary behavior.  Google Translate partially adopted
transformers but also generally favored an alternative technology that turned
out to be not super discontinuous.  DeepL instead launched fast with
transfomers to be the first on the market with a full transformer generative AI
product.  That was the visionary stage, I think.

![](231209-mt-visionary-sm.png "Look at that happy little robot visionary. I
remember the days when the transformer team came to us and insisted we launch
it asap.  Too bad we missed that boat"){fig-align="center"}

Then the market wandered through a variety of other niche markets that were
larger in size.  I wasn't totally paying attention at this time since I was
still with Google Translate, but looking back I'd say companies like
[Jasper](http://jasper.ai/) were a key niche market for transformers, now in
the form of General Pretrained Transformers or GPT for short.  And
[OpenAI](https://openai.com/) was the leading vendor for transformers.  Others
were competing and trying things out, but they were building, serving, and
hosting the whole core product pretty effectively.

Then [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) came out and *absolutely* crushed the
bowling alley by gaining 100 million users in light-speed.  That week made it
absolutely clear that transformers had left the chasm hard.  They left the
world of niche markets with zero looking back.  They had started a tornado.
And *everyone* was buying.  A bajillion startups were using OpenAI's APIs to
build thin wrappers that then sold a generative AI product to some niche
audience, all while more and more customers consolidated around OpenAI's
product and standards.

![](231209-state-of-bowling-alley-sm.png "And now the time for bowling is
over"){fig-align="center"}

Now we have a transformative technology, transformers, flowing through the
market with clear players.  It's teetering now on main street.  What's not
clear is what exactly is the whole product solution that wraps around
transformers to make a truly commoditized product any customer can leverage
with glee and satisfaction.  Nor is it clear who is going to make it through
the tornado and end up on top.  But let's make some wild assertions.

## Let's do some positioning Open AI and everyone else

Moore sets out a few key criteria for placing each company into the Gorilla,
Chimp, and Monkey bucket.  With Gorilla's there's only one.  They define the
product and the standard that everyone competes with.  They get the best profit
margin and as they sell, they get stronger.  The chimps are solid alternatives
that just didn't quite get main street customer attention as fast.  Maybe they
sold too slowly for "reasons".  Monkeys are all the companies that sell a
product similar to the Gorilla but with key features missing and much lower
cost, primarily because they're not setup to push the market forward.

With that reminder, I'm going to throw down some hot takes.

Right now, OpenAI is clearly the market leader.  They are the gorilla.  They
almost committed suicide with the Board firing Sam Altman, but with them back
they're likely stronger than ever.  Why are they the gorilla? Well first, Sam
Altman is no dummy.  He's from Y-Combinator and knows how high tech market
works and he likely wants to be the winner, even if he doesn't have an equity
stake in the company.  More importantly tho, if you look at literally any other
LLM product such as [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/),
[Pinecone](http://pinecone.io/), and *any* open source product, they integrate
with the OpenAI API format.  Even brand new open source models find silly ways
to fit into OpenAI's function calling format, however painful it is.  I haven't
seen anyone do that for [Anthropic's
API](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api),
[Co:here's API](https://docs.cohere.com/), and especially not for any of
Google's APIs.  So, gorilla is now identified.

![](231209-openai-top-duck-sm.png "That duck? That's OpenAI looking out across the
market. I'm tired of the Gorilla analogy"){fig-align="center"}

And who are the chimps? The other companies developing and furthering the
technology but not taking a market leadership position.  Clearly this is
[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and [Co:here](https://cohere.com/).
Anthropic has been pushing forward hard with aligned AI and constitutional AI
to carve out their premium positioning.  Cohere has been....I'm not quite sure
what they've been doing but it looks like they're doing well.  Unless Sam
Altman gets fired again, neither company will replace OpenAI but they'll keep
going and provide solid meaningful alternatives. 

But where does Google live? They invented transformers in the first place.
They even have a fancy new model called
[Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/) that they're about to
release.  But, they dropped the ball hard in a few ways.  Just days ago with
Gemini they made what I believe is a hard fatal mistake.  They put out a [great
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV1vkHv4zq8) that advances customer
perception of how they could use generative AI and then they made clear that
they did *lots* of careful behind the scenes editing to make that happen and
they didn't even release the top line model with the video.  This means they
pushed the market demand forward and expanded the whole product and will be
absolutely unable to sell the promised product.  They put a delicious lunch on
the table and said to every single competitor "Here, eat my lunch.  I won't be
doing so".  Whoever actually delivers the product described in the Gemini video
will crush it financially, and it won't be Google.  Given Google's inability to
ship, they're not a gorilla, not a chimp, not even a monkey.  They're a dying
gorilla.  It won't kill Google overall, but it puts them out of the game in
this new market for sure.

![](231209-google-sad-penguin-sm.png "That penguin? It's Google. Penguins
obviously don't survive long in the desert."){fig-align="center"}

Now what about my most controversial statement? That Open Source Models are
monkeys? For the consumer market this is maybe not true.  Perhaps there's a key
consumer market that needs and wants fully local and private models.  And
perhaps there's enterprise customers that absolutely need 100% on premise
solutions.  Those exist, but they're not the size of the rest of the market.
Open source model developers and hosts will do well in those markets but they
without a doubt won't be unseating OpenAI as a Gorilla.  For OpenAI's key
market, they'll be a low cost and low latency clone.  Already [Together
Compute](http://together.ai/), which I adore a lot, is selling a whole suite of
open source models as a service and marketing it as both faster and cheaper
than OpenAI's services.  They don't describe any key innovations that go beyond
cost and speed.  That's clear monkey activity as per Moore.  Breaks my heart to
say it, but if they act appropriately, they can still make a good deal of
money, as long as they don't get aggressive and pretend to be a Gorilla in
OpenAI's market.  Instead it's for them to develop a side market that OpenAI
doesn't care about and try to position themselves as a market leader.

## Handwaving towards the future

Now, what is the future like? I suspect we're still figuring out the whole
product solution.  I'm pretty sure the whole product includes at a minimum:

* A Large Language Model, ala GPT-4
* Function calling, as found in GPT-4
* A semantic vector service like Pinecone
* A retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup like LangChain
* Hosting for all this

For the last year those were mostly sold separately sold separately with
OpenAI, Pinecone, LangChain, and probably Azure or AWS being the key providers.
But now with OpenAI's [Assistants
API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) (and the consumer
facing GPTs) we can see OpenAI doing exactly what Moore would expect.  They are
designing out their old partners and commodotized the whole product into a
single bundle that OpenAI sells.  It may not be the best overall solution, but
in majority markets with pragmatic buyers that want a clear singular standard
they can rely on, this strategy often works really well and creates the winner.
So assuming OpenAI doesn't lose the ball, they look to be the winner.

![](231209-ai-assistant-sm.png "In the future, we won't have to do any real
work because our AI Assistants will take on human form and do the work for us.
Such a blessing of the market"){fig-align="center"}

What's after that? I suspect with AI assistants serving as the commodity whole
product, once it gets 100% worked out and crystalized into a standard we'll see
OpenAI start to go back to customer first behaviors as they serve the main
market with +1 niche solutions.  Already I expect that OpenAI itself wouldn't
even be building out these niches but instead leverage a two sided market place
(i.e. the GPTs store).  If they do that, then it really is game over for the
market with OpenAI being the new Google in the Generative AI market.

But, let's wait and see.

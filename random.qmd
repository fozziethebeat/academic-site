## Taking Mandarin Classes

I took Mandarin Chinese back in 2010 while in grad school and it was really
helpful with my buddhist practice and when I ended up visiting China.  Now tho
I need to improve my mandarin due to my Chinese family in law.  So, time to
find a decent class.  Here's a few things I'm looking at.

  Maybe a good set of group lessons? Group seems nice to put the social
  pressure on me.
